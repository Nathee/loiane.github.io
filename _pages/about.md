Hi, I'm Loiane Groner, a software developer from Brazil. I've been working with software development for 10+ years and I'm currently working as business analyst and senior Java/HTML5/JavScript developer at an american financial institution.

I've written some books for [Packt Publishing](//www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/loiane-groner) and also have been given the opportunity to speak at some conferences about Java, JavaScript, Sencha, Ionic and Angular. Iâ€™ve also taught workshops in US and Brazil.

I always try to contribute with the communitty sharing what I've learned. I also maintain a training portal ([https://loiane.training](https://loiane.training)) with free courses in Portuguese.
